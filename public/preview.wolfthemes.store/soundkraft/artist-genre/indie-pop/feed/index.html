					<description><![CDATA[Ella Nova is a rising star in the indie pop scene, known for her ethereal voice and dreamy soundscapes. Growing up in a small coastal town in Oregon, Ella spent her early years singing in local coffee shops and at community events. Influenced by the sounds of artists like Lana Del Rey and Lorde, she developed a unique blend of soft vocals, atmospheric instrumentation, and introspective lyrics that resonated with a wide audience. Her debut album, "Sea of Stars," was written over the course of two years, drawing inspiration from the natural beauty of her surroundings and her personal experiences of love and loss. The album captivated audiences with its blend of heartfelt lyrics and lush production, earning critical acclaim and a dedicated fan base. Ella is now working on her second album, which promises to push the boundaries of indie pop even further. When she's not in the studio, you can find her hiking the Oregon coast or reading poetry in her garden.]]></description>
