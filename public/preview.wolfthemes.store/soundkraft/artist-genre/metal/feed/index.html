					<description><![CDATA[Metal band from Sweden, known for their intense sound and powerful live performances, Black Horizon is known for their aggressive, thrash-influenced sound and intense live performances. The band was formed in 2015 by guitarist and lead vocalist Erik Larsson, along with drummer Johan Nilsson and bassist Linnea Berg. Drawing inspiration from bands like Metallica, Slayer, and Lamb of God, Black Horizon’s music is fast, heavy, and unapologetically brutal. Their debut album, "Into the Abyss," was released in 2017 and immediately caught the attention of metal fans and critics alike. The album's themes of inner turmoil, societal collapse, and existential dread struck a chord with listeners, and the band's technical musicianship set them apart from their peers. Following the success of their debut, Black Horizon toured extensively across Europe, playing at major festivals like Wacken Open Air and Bloodstock. Their sophomore album, "Shattered Worlds," was released in 2020 and saw the band refining their sound while exploring darker, more complex themes. The album has been praised for its intricate guitar work, pounding rhythms, and Erik's powerful, guttural vocals. Despite the intensity of their music, the band is known for their humility and dedication to their fans, often hosting meet-and-greets and backstage Q&#38;A sessions.]]></description>
